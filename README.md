# Deadjournal
### It's Livejournal, but not as we know it

[Deadjournal](https://alephnaughtpix.github.io/deadjournal/) is a recreation of my old Livejournal blog, but not on Livejournal, (as that's now on a Russian server) as well as an ongoing experiment into the delights of maintaining a blog based on the Jekyll system and hosted on GitHub pages.
