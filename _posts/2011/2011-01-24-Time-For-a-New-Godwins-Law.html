<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin's Law</a> (<em>&quot;As 
an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or 
Hitler approaches 1.&quot;</em>) was relevant in 1989 when it was first coined by Mike 
Godwin, but has since become redundant in US politics as the Overton Window gracelessly 
lumbers rightward, and needs to be updated.</p>

longer, the probability of the right winger invoking Godwin's Law in order to shut 
further discussion of their views approaches 1.&quot;</em></p>
