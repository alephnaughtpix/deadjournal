The other day, I noticed Twitter user [@letsgoayo](https://twitter.com/letsgoayo) flag this one up. Someone has responded in a conversation on Twitter. (Presumably on the  usual "'high' verses 'low' culture" debates, and it's relation to poltiics.) <!--more-->

> Why is that bad? I generally don't think people who don't go to the opera and the ballet and read good books and are the sort of people who should have power. They certainly aren't the sort of people I like.

I noticed the absolute dog-whistle of a phrase:*"the sort of people I like"*, and had to repond.

> "the sort of people I like" is a big tell here. It isn't really about one's personal preferences, it's about whether you're one of **them**

Obviously, I don't think going to the opera or reading good books should  be a requirement for holding power. **However**, if we're going to go in that direction, I'd recommend the following to the original poster.

Here's a clip from the last opera I attended before lockdown. That was  *["Nixon in China"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_in_China/)* by John Adams, and this is the aria from the end of Act 2, *"I Am the Wife of Mao Tse-Tung"*. Enjoy!

In terms of good books, the most recent I have read is*["The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheFaggots%26TheirFriendsBetweenRevolutions)* by Larry Mitchell. Happy reading!

**NOTE:** I don't normally consume that revolutionary-themed media all the time, but the coincidence was just too amusing!
