Yesterday, I started to get shivers reminiscent of a fever, and I started to panic. Have I got Covid-19? It seemed a pretty mild fever, but I had been seeing reports of symptoms suddenly coming on like a ton of bricks. <!--more--> 

I alerted my husband and pretty quickly he moved most of his stuff out of the bedroom to the living room, and set up the spare bed there. Thus started my period of isolation. 

Overnight, I started developing a fever, not a full fever, but stronger than yesterday, and by today I spent most of the day just sleeping whilst my body temperature alternates between sweating like a pig and freezing like a pig carcass in a fridge.

This evening, things have calmed down a bit, so I was able to type this one. (Yep, my laptop's on my bed now. You can't do it all on a phone.)

Am I worried? You bet. It looks like whatever this is may be calming down, but I'll want to wait over the days of isolation, because I want to be sure, and I also want to be sure that **if** this is the dreaded virus, I don't pass it onto my husband.

So I'm staying in the bedroom for the next 7 days. Today I was only venturing out to get a glass of water or go to the loo. My husband has it even worse. He has to stay isolated for 7 days after that. We've alerted friends and family, and a couple of friends are helping by delivering groceries to outside the front door, but this is going to a tense next fortnight.
