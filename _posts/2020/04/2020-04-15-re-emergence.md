Well, I was wanting to do this blog post to explore the fact that 
1. I have no Covid-19 sypmtons after seven days, and so I'm okay, and
2. How do i feel now, as I walk outside?

The answer is, to be honest, not that much different. I drink in the spring air, and celbrate that I'm alive, but nothing has changed whilst I do my usual afternoon walk. However, maybe that right, maybe I shouldn't expect the world to change, or my perception of it to change?
