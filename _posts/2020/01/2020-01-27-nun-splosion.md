So, for my first appearance as a [Nun]({{ "/tag/opi.html" | relative_url }}) in 2020, I've gone in at the deep end, and went to the **Cardiff Exequator**!

If you've seen my previous [primer]({{"/2019/06/21/a-quick-primer-on-the-order-of-perpetual-indulgence.html" | relative_url}}) post on the Order, you'll have seen pictures of the Order in Cardiff, but what is an "Exequator"? <!--more-->

In the Order, when a group is has grown enough, and is judged ready to become an independent House, and make it's own decisions, an Exequator is the occasion in which this is celebrated. Members of the Order come from all over (including all over the *world*, especially from the United States.) to celbrate the birth of a new House. So, just a bit more than me meeting up with Cardiff and Bristol Sisters this time...

**Friday 24th**

The actual Exequator occasion was to happen on Saturday 25th, but there was to be a meet and greet on the day before. Myself, Novice Sauchie Ball Street and Hench Rietta went down on the plane. We had already worked out that the cheapest route was by air! This was even given the fact that there were now no direct flights to Cardiff as there had been when I last went down the previous August. (These flights were run by FlyBe, so perhaps it was just as well, given that they basically went into adminstration the week we were planning on going.) We planned to fly to Bristol, and get a hired car to go to Cardiff, which was just over the River Severn. As they were going back on a different day, I could make my way by bus or train to Bristol. (Sir Carrie A. Lotte was also coming down by plane, but at a later time.)

Of course, it wasn't that simple. The flight from Glasgow was delayed by over an hour, and when we got down to the hire car dealer, things looked right dodgy: there was a queue of people complaining about the terms and unlisted costs. After overhearing things and making our own calculations, we worked out that it would be quicker to get an Uber into Cardiff, so we did. 

We finally ended up in central Cardiff just as the Meet 'n' Greet was about to begin. Luckily, Novice Sauchie and Hench Rietta's hotel was just around the corner from the location. (Just as well, as I was still lugging about my wheely case.) The location was [The Golden Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Cross%2C_Cardiff), a lovely old-school pub with small stage, which would be full of various acts each night.

The first familiar people I bumped into when I went in were actually from the Order in Edinburgh! We had been allowed use of the VIP back room, which was lined with various bric-a-brac, including ships-in-bottles, and various strange books. Eventually more drifted in, most in their "secular" clothes. Here's someone who shares the same name as me, spells the first name different ways: mine is "Michael", his is "Micheal".

Eventually, we all started going back to our respective placces. In my case, I was staying with **Brother Huw Jorgan**, who was also hosting **Sister Krisko** from the US.

**Saturday 25th**

I decided to have a bit of a wander around Cardiff city centre, during which I popped by a store in the [Castle Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Arcade), and found some new trinkets, including a huge silver-coloured plastic crucifix! I went back to Brother Huw's place, and we started to [Manifest]({{ "/tag/manifesting.html" | relative_url }}). Novice Phillipa Chasm turned up late, and got ready in record time! Sister Krisko's look was particularly divine.

We went, as is Brother Huw's wont, down to the Exequator venue in the bus. (I've done this before with Huw and co when I was down at Cardiff Pride last year.) There's a bus into the centre just outside Huw's house, and not much walking after that. We don't usually get any bother going down in the bus, and walking down the Cardiff centre streets. If we get any reaction, it's more along the lines of *"Oh my goodness, you look **amazing**!"*.

The venue for the Exequator was [Mary's](https://www.maryscardiff.co.uk/cardiff), on St. Mary's Street. This a fairly big club venue, with a VIP back room, which where the Exequator was taking place. It was pretty clear early on that this venue was absolutely **packed** with Nuns from all over the place. I got talking to **Sister Polly Amarosa** from the Manchester House. I'd already seen Sister Polly on a documentary called "[We Are Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJSbUwqmYGk)" at SQIFF last year, so it was nice to talk to them in person.

At one corner was a throne, obviously designed for photo opportunites.

Due to the room being packed, we moved out to the large smoking area outside, and conducted the Exequator ceremony there. It started with Invitations to the gathered faithful to praise the Cardiff Sisters, and give them gifts, and many took that opportunity, including Sister Sauchie of our Order, who also gifted Cardiff a guestbook for the occasion.

Then (then) Novice Gloria Snockers from Cardiff and Sister Ann from Bristol (the Mother House of Cardiff) led the ceremony, during which the in-joke amongst the Cardiff Order became an offical title: Cardiff are now officially the "Chiffron Borg"! And then all the Novices were Elevated to Sisters, and then we all had a party, and then I seem to remember dancing on the stage with a few other Sisters, and then getting the Night Bus home with Huw and Phillipa.

**Sunday 26th**

Sunday afternoon was the comedown. We were all to meet up in the afternoon in the [WOW Bar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/WOW+Bar/@51.4835989,-3.1756667,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x486e1cb7650972f3:0x80294cde9dbe2113!8m2!3d51.4835989!4d-3.1734727), although there was talk in social media of various Brunch happenings around the city centre. Huw and myself Manifested, but when we went there, it turns out it we were the only ones to do so. I suspect Brother Huw is like me: any excuse to don the Habit. Yesterday, I was wearing my formal Habit, but today I was wearing my pink Habit, which is a little more figure-hugging. (Which I understand was much commented upon.)

Various other people drifted in who were, shall we say, delicate. As evening approached, we all started drifting off (Most of my fellow Glaswegians were leaving to go back up to Glasgow that evening.) and I left with Huw and Krisko. Back at Huw's we chilled out, and had a Skype call with Gloria, who by then was back in their house.

**Monday 27th**

I left Huw's place early-ish. I had been planning on getting a MegaBus to Bristol Airport, but the previous night Gloria had suggested I get the train to Bristol Temple Meads, and get the airport bus from there. After checking online for the fares versus the time I wanted to get to the airport, I decided on the train as the better balance. This turned out to be a good decision, as the bus was experiencing delays according to the app, and I might have missed my flight. 

In any case, it was a joy getting the train from Cardiff Central, and then (via a stop at Newport) alighting in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's incredible train shed at Bristol Temple Meads. (As featured in "[The Young Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTd1SSYYyss)", one of my most formative comedy shows in the 1980s!) And from there, it was a simple wait for the bus outside, and from there it was an easy ride home.
