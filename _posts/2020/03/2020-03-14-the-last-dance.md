So, almost a week into me working from, I publicly appeared as Novice Wye Dangle of the [OPI]({{ "/tag/opi.html" | relative_url }}), and I was guessing that this might be the last time I do this in public for a while. <!--more-->

It was for "Gallus Gals", a night organised by the Vespa Girls, in which Novice Sauchie Ball-Street of our Glasgow Mission was to particpate, so we all turned out. Amongst all of us, there was a feeling that might be the last gasp before the rumoured lockdown happens. Indeed, one of the billed performers pulled out after apparently exhibiting symptons of Covid-19.

So, we were all a bit nervous. As a sign of things to come, we'd already learned during the week that the planned Trans Pride at the end of this month had already been cancelled. This evening, we found out that Bi-Tastic! in Birmingham has also been cancelled. 

Even worse, tonight was taking place in the [Britannia Panopticon](https://www.britanniapanopticon.org/). An amazing space, an old music hall venue, famous for giving [Stan Laurel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Laurel) his first performance. Unfortunately, temperature wise, it's like being in a fridge at the best of times. I was wearing copius amounts of underwear underneath my Pink Habit. I was even wearing *socks* under my winter closed-toed sandals.

So, how did it go? Actually, really well.

The Vespa Girls were old school drag queens, and did acts that perfectly conformed with the music hall venue. Novice Sauchie performed an act which detailed where she had been, to where she was a Nun, and she did this whilst actually Manifesting into Novice Sauchie. 

Then at the end, I helped with Novice Sauchie the Elevation process of turning Page Turns Her into Squire Turns Her. (Middle of this picture.)

This about the fourth Elevation I've overseen, and by this time, myself, as Novice Wye, and Novice Sauchie, have developed this double-act, where I'm the "middle class" version,with the complex [Polari]({{ "/tag/polari.html" | relative_url }}) bits, and Novice Sauchie is the "Glasgow" version. (Ironic, since, when I joined, **I** was the Glasgow version!) I'm really enjoying it at this point, since it feels like we're doing something that appeals to a Glaswegian audience, whilst having a luagh, and imparting some new knowledge.
