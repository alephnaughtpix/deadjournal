One thing I have been seing recently on Twitter is that people have been posting instructions for washing hands in order to ward off [Covid-19]({{ "/tag/covid19.html" | relative_url }}). Originally it was to the lyrics of *"Happy Birthday"*, but more recently, <!--more--> it's been to other lyrics, such as Salt 'n' Pepa's *"Push it"*.

This turned out to be from a website called "[Wash Your Lyrics](https://washyourlyrics.com/)". Just put in an artist and song name, and it'll get the lyrics, and fit them to a hand-washing infographic. Or, at least, that's the theory. I tried putting in a Sex pistols song, and the site couldn't find the lyrics, so instead rather bizzarely gave me the opening lines of the script from the movie "[24 Hour Party People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hour_Party_People)", starring Steve Coogan as [Factory Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Records) founder Tony WIlson.

However, all is not lost. I found a song that the site did recognise, and now I have a new jam for wshing my hands...
