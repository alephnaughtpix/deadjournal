So, pretty much on the heels for Boris Johnson announcing the lockdown, I received news from my workplace <!--more--> that a hefty chunk of the employees- including myself- will be moved into the Government's Furlough scheme, by which then can claim 80% of my current wage back from the Government. They want to keep on all their employees, and are using the Furlough scheme to keep those employees during the lockdown.

So, effectively for the next couple of months, I'm effectively being paid to *not* work.  It's almost like a Universal Income- and it's being implemented a right-wing Tory Government! If this is possible, then the pandemic might *already* be changing our world.
