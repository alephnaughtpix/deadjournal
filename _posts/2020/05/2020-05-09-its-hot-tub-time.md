As you might guess, this is not really an original Frank Sinatra recording, but the results of an AI program, called [OpenAI Jukebox](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/), trained on Frank Sinatra recordings. The Sinatra voice is not too bad, but as you might have noticed from the start, the music is, well, *interesting*. In fact, it seems to meander around without ever approaching what appears to be a tune, adding to it's further unncanny valley qualities.
