Whilst researching for a virtual "pub" quiz, I found out that the first-ever commercially digitally recorded record released to the public was this lovely jazz recording.

It's an album called *"Something"*  by **Steve Marcus + Jiro Inagaki & Soul Media**. The title track is based on the Beatles song by George Harrison off the album Abbey Road, which was less than two years old when this was recorded. (Jan 1971). It's done very much in the style of  Mile Davis' 1969 album *"[In a Silent Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Silent_Way)"*.

This was the second to be recorded using the same recording setup, but the first to be released. (Feb 1972)  Due to the primitive nature of the early digital recording process (It was essentially the equivalent of an analogue stereo reel-to-reel.) the entire album was recorded in one single take.
