When I popped into a cafe earlier today, there was a radio sofly playing an "Oldies" station.<!--more-->

And the "oldie" that was playing? Only "Bohemian Like You" by the Dandy Worhols! That record was already a hit when I was past it, and now it's an "oldie"!!

*Note this is the original version of the video, so it contains some brief nudity.*
