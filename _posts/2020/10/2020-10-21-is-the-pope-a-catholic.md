It may be an old joke, but I suspect many will be asking this for real. And it'll be hilarious. <!--more-->

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: Pope Francis endorses same-sex civil unions for the first time as pope while being interviewed for the feature-length documentary “Francesco.” “Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God,” Francis said. <a href="https://t.co/09ita0KtSI">https://t.co/09ita0KtSI</a></p>&mdash; The Associated Press (@AP) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP/status/1318917841404497923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Of course, as some have already noted, it's not the first time Pope Francis [has said something like this](https://www.newwaysministry.org/2017/09/02/pope-francis-says-he-supports-civil-unions-for-lesbian-and-gay-couples/). However, if can get over the antiquated phrasing of *"Homosexual people"*, this does seem like a (very belated) step in the right direction.
