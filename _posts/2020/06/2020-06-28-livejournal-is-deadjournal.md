It's official. My old Livejournal, the impetus behind this blog, is no more. <!--more-->

As part of this project, I had imported posts from my old LiveJournal into this blog, then I'd deleted the LiveJournal. (The reason *why* I deleted it is [explained here.]({{"/2019/05/22/About-Deadjournal.html"|relative_url}}).) However, it wasn't just gone. When a blog is marked for deletion in LiveJournal, it may disappear from public view, but the old data remains for **up to a year**, in case I might want to resurrect it, until it finally gets deleted. 

That happened today.  And here is the evidence.

In case you're wondering... I didn't sign up for the mail-alert informing me of when it got deleted, as giving them an email address for their database would kind of defeat the purpose of deleting the blog. So I simply marked the date in a diary entry on my phone.

So, at the start of this evening, a little reminder popped up on my phone from a year and a universe ago. Now I can mark it as complete!
