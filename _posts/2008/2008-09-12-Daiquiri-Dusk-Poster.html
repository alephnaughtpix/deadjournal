<p>Because I'm still in my early days, not originally coming from an art background, and being a bit green about this thing they call "networking", it's often a bit hard for me to gauge feedback on my photo work, or, for that matter, if anyone notices it.</p>
<p>So it made my day when someone who's work I admired contacted me through Flickr today, telling me that someone they were shooting gave her a pic and said "I want to look like that". The image? My recent "Poster" image of Daquari Dusk! :-O</p>
<p>It's a small world after all...</p>
