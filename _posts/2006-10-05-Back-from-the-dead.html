<p>Have you ever experienced a time of limbo whenever you were waiting to find out if 
someone you knew was alive or dead? When you're fresh with the memories of them as a 
vital living person, and not too sure if that's all you're going to have by the end of 
the same day. Wondering on earth to do if the worst happens, whilst still ready welcome 
them with open arms when they appear next again.</p>

<p>I've been recently acquainted with such a feeling. One of my close friends went 
overseas (By overseas, I mean <i>real</i> overseas, outside the Eurozone) to meet the 
love of his life. They had met when she was over here for a year of her university course. 
Now she's back in her own country, and Friend A goes over for a week. About 4 days into 
the week, two unknown men threaten in him, and tell him in no uncertain terms to back off 
his girl.</p>

<p>This is the first time he's ever been overseas, and he's travelling alone.</p>

<p>So he calls one of my other friends back home, and is right pissed off. He's off to 
the pub, he tells her. I meet Friend B later for dinner at 
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;hs=BSq&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;q=ichiban&amp;amp;near=Glasgow&amp;amp;radius=0.0&amp;amp;latlng=55865627,-4257224,10567381533569310274&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1"><b>Ichiban</b></a>, 
and almost as soon as she's told me the latest, friend A phones from his hotel room 
overseas. He's clearly drunk a lot. "I'm in Hell," he croaks. And then he says he has 
written "a note". I say what kind of note, and he hangs up.</p>

<p>A little bit spooked, I try phoning again- no reply. I go back to my noodles, whilst 
friend B phones him up, but my appetite is a little subdued: a <i>note</i>? Surely he's 
aware of the possible implication of saying something like that. Friend B comes back. 
The conversation with A was a bit surreal. He couldn't get through to the girlfriend on 
the phone, but apparently he will be sober in the morning, whether or not the note applies. 
Er, excuse me? Whether or not the note <i>applies</i>? Oh yes, and he also had a message 
to pass onto his girlfriend. This is sounding more and more ominous by the moment.</p>

<p>B phones up the girlfriend and apparently A was threatening suicide, which was why she 
was not answering his calls. Oh and can you pass this message onto A? B, feeling a little 
like one of those children passing on messages between estranged parents, diplomatically 
suggested suggested it would probably be better if Girlfriend of A passes on the message 
to him herself. "This is not good at all" B comments later. When B says something is not 
good she means it.</p>

<p>We retire to the pub for a drink and watch the football. We're saying things like 
"Oh, he'll probably be OK" and basically putting a brave face on things, but we're doing 
it under a massive cloud. </p>

<p>The next morning I phone his hotel phone number, not knowing what to expect. For the 
past 12 hours, A's been in a limbo state; both dead and alive- like 
<a href="http://www.galactic-guide.com/articles/8R56.html">Schrodinger's Cat</a>, waiting 
for the box to be opened. <br /><br />The phone is answered almost immediately. As soon 
as I say hello, a familiar voice, sounding very hangover goes: <i>"Oh hi man, how you 
doing?"</i></p>
