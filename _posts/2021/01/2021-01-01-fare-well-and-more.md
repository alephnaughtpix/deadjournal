Scotland said goodbye to 2020 with  **Fare Well**. Written by Jackie Kay, with music by Niteworks, this  series of videos shows (a then record-breaking) 150 LED drones flying in formation, illustrating Kay's poetry. <!--more-->

There's a version with all three parts together, but I think it works better as three seperate videos.

I say "then record-breaking", as mere hours after the thrid and final video in the series was released, London's New Year celebrations featured an LED drone show with 300 drones. It was interesting that although coming from a different angle, it was largely covering the same subjects "Fare Well" had, and even featured a similar bird pictogram to the one seen in "Fare Well"

However, South Korea blew that number out of the water with it's New Year drone show- 1000 drones! This performance has a much more upbeat tone to it.
