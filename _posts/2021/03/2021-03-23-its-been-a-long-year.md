Why do I say this on the 23rd of March? <!--more-->

Well, it's been a year to the day since the UK [went into lockdown](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish?page=with:block-5e78c9928f08cc9a81946ba3#liveblog-navigation/) due to the COVID-19 virus.

... And we're still in lockdown! There might have been some brief respite over summer and autumn last year, but those easing of restrictions pretty much ended with winter, and the cases were soaring to new peaks this past couple of months, it looks like it's pretty much here to say for the time being. Perhaps the rollout of vaccines will help in the coming months, but this time we know we can't rely on [herd immunity](https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-12/british-government-wants-uk-to-acquire-coronavirus-herd-immunity-writes-robert-peston).
