<p><a title="Orderly Disorder March 2010 by alephnaught, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/4419920103/"><img width="500" height="369" alt="Orderly Disorder March 2010" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4419920103_166be70910.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The above picture is from my regular club photography gig at Orderly Disorder in The 
Flying Duck in Glasgow. Over the past two years I've been sliding into 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/collections/72157612721067698/">club
photography</a>, starting with a few innocent snaps with a little compact in 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/sets/72157594569180519/">The 
Riverside club during Utter Gutter</a>. I think that the thing that connects my work, 
from those days to now, is the attempt to capture a slice of time that captures the 
essence of what I consider to be the original USP of the rave sensibility that begat 
modern clubbing: the spontaneity of adults in play, not giving a monkeys.</p>
<p>So many times in the old pre-rave days, as now, dancing was regarded as a courtship 
ritual, and it was judged: do you dance like Travolta, or someone's dad? The great thing 
about rave, which flowered as I hit university, was that you danced because you 
<i>wanted</i> to dance- usually prompted by some incredible tune, pumping from the 
speakers straight into your brain- and so did the entire universe around you.</p>
<p>I wasn't then aware of the <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/35453.html" 
rel="nofollow">Japanese proverb</a> quoted in the title, but it makes perfect sense. Let 
people dance like their dads, or even their dad's dads: as long as they are dancing like 
<i>themselves</i>, comfortable in their movement, movement that they fully own. Their 
movement and nobody else's. Better to dance and be thought a fool. After all, we are 
fools, whether we dance or not.</p>
