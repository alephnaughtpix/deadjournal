<div class="question">
	<p class="title">Pet Talk</p>
	<p class="text">If your pet could talk, what is the first thing s/he would say to you?</p>
</div>
<p>I've got two cats, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/4310207300/">Oscar</a>
and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/4263085474/">Ellie</a>. Ellie's the 
boss, and Oscar's the &quot;shy&quot; one. I put &quot;shy&quot; in quotes because he's 
not too shy around me. <!--more-->As soon as I'm any where near a chair, up he pops, tail in the 
air, meowing in a low dry growl, like a cross between 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGbZm-h1zac">Henry's Cat</a> and 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VOYcRXzs1Y">Tom Waits</a>&nbsp;. Ellie, despite 
being the boss cat, has what one of my friends would describe as <em>&quot;Oh my gosh, 
that's like the daintiest cat meow like <strong>ever</strong>&quot;. </em>But she's 
always meowing at me, especially when I'm in bed. I'll be reading something, and I hear a 
little dainty noise behind the book, usually as a prelude to Ellie's head popping up above 
the pages, and attempting to head-butt the book down. Something tells me she's looking 
for attention. Maybe she's jealous of the attention that Oscar's getting.</p>
<p>So as far as I'm concerned, the cats are already talking to me, and have been for
some time. However, if they were to talk in <em>English</em>, I suspect it would be 
something a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EastEnders">EastEnders</a>, 
with Oscar as Frank Butcher<em>&nbsp;(&quot;Awright, ma saaaaahhhn?&quot;)</em> and 
Ellie as Dot Cotton. Actually, thinking on that, it's perhaps just as well they don't 
speak English, as I flippin hate EastEnders, and it would do my head in.</p>
