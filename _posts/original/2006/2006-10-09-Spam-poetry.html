I've been extremely lucky in the sense that most of my email is <i>not</i> mainly spam. (Something to do with me being loathe to give out my email addresses to complete strangers.) So I've missed out on the creative revolution occuring in spam mail as it becomes ever more desperate to evade spam filters. I am of course talking about <b>spam poetry</b>, a randomly generated paragraph of text at the start of some spam messages which bears a resemblence to some modern poetry. I remember reading about this phenomenon somewhere.(It might have been an isse of <b>G2</b> when I was bored in some pub.). Now I have experienced it for myself. My work address has been occasionally getting the odd bit of spam, so I shall share a couple of the more interesting "compostions with you:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Investors Watch Out!<br /><br /></b>Audio of quality variety games available.<br />Friends  play learn Services Safetyuse of this in site signifies.<br />Ideas thoughts  Anything except amkysen Feedback or.<br />Pmyfcinc Users Chinese Erichsu am akar  thu am Dutch Welkom het garo Finnish.<br /><br /><b>Read More Online Now!</b><br /><br />Other pmwynn creation editing am playback in sounds images video Xmms mplayer.<br />Monkeh moocha moppsy Myworld?<br />Kanniball karurosu Kidel Fastro Lord am bob mathio.<br />Except amkysen Feedback Report a spam misplaced guideline is thread talk?<br />Bob mathio Monkeh moocha moppsy am Myworld am.<br />Make sure is words are spelled try of different keywords general fewer.<br />Espaol usuarios Hispanos Bass Stolz is pmekz Languages Dont speak English or well.<br />Amnixnut Software covers software posted might harm.<br />Sites details.<br />Poe.<br />Feb in Problem is?<br />At is will find objective.<br />Note.<br />Place other.<br />Robintw am Sankukai Sirkut?<br /><br /><b>Two Photos</b><br /><br />Strongest oeuvre Writer Richard Meltzer.<br />Playing la clubs April rapidly became.<br />Frank Fayad George in lead.<br />Jangly guitars replaced airy elusive artsongs jazz a classical Some derided!<br /><br /><b>Breaking News!</b><br /><br />Several in its in entirety split citing alcohol chronic renamed itself Band am partisans charged power.<br />Clubs April rapidly or.<br />Line manage stay together further single Mind.<br />Personnel lyrics a french a Retrieved in Folk Prepunk a Article or Edit.<br />Served san meanwhile assembled new lineup in very different band a jay Donnellan?<br />My Diary for of Rosa Brooks which included Jimi Hendrix guitar of Sons of.<br />Little red am Book in meantime dismissed replacing them Alban Snoopy Pfisterer.<br />Message no Vidahey a ora House not?<br />Element.<br />Lead vocals or This!<br />Book Tenn leukemia am albumsmay albums.<br />Message no Vidahey ora!<br />Them Alban Snoopy Pfisterer!<br />Artsongs am jazz.<br />Five had been recording with.</i></blockquote>
