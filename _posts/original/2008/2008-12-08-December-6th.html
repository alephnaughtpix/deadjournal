<ol><li>Got the three pieces to Jeff at the Phoenix Centre. I've found I'm going to need to get some string for hanging. (The pieces have been hung before, but on chains, not hung from the wall.) I'm realising now that Jeff is actually a bit familiar to me, I've seen him occasionaly about town. I've taken the opportunity to show some more of my photos, and he likes them, and so there might be opportunity for more stuff to be shown.<br /></li><li>Took quite a few pics today in and about Glasgow. It was a very cold day, and it was almost like sunset all day.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/3086514517/" title="Reflective Seat (06 Dec 2008) by alephnaught, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/3086514517_f289869239_m.jpg" alt="Reflective Seat (06 Dec 2008)" border="0" width="180" height="240" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/3087351078/" title="Abandoned Glove (06 Dec 2008) by alephnaught, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3189/3087351078_885c3fa903_m.jpg" alt="Abandoned Glove (06 Dec 2008)" border="0" width="180" height="240" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/3086514273/" title="Smoking Bin (06 Dec 2008) by alephnaught, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3030/3086514273_e5eaf46e9a_m.jpg" alt="Smoking Bin (06 Dec 2008)" border="0" width="187" height="240" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/3086511671/" title="Guard Penguin (06 Dec 2008) by alephnaught, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3082/3086511671_d9caa00f78_m.jpg" alt="Guard Penguin (06 Dec 2008)" border="0" width="180" height="240" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/3087348210/" title="Lunch Hour for Pigeons (06 Dec 2008) by alephnaught, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/3087348210_4d47a07967_m.jpg" alt="Lunch Hour for Pigeons (06 Dec 2008)" border="0" width="240" height="180" /></a></li></ol>
