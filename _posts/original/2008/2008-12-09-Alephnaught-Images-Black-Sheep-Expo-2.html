<p class="commentary">The Phoenix Centre mentioned here has since been knocked down. The sprawling campus of <a href="https://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk/">City of Glasgow College</a> now occupies it's place.</p>
<p>My work is appearing in Black Sheep production's second exhibition of up-and-coming artists, at the Phoenix Centre, Glasgow. <br /><br />The
opening will be on <b>Friday 12th Dec 6pm-10pm</b>. There will be
entertainment and nibbles. Bring yourself, bring a friend or two, and
come to Glasgow's newest art space for an exciting exhibition of new
art from unknown talent.</p>
<p>The Phonenix Centre is easy to find:
just go down St James road from the Royal Infirmary, and look for the
building that looks like an old school, and that'll be it. Here's the
link from Google Maps.</p>
