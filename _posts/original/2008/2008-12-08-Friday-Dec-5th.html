<p class="commentary">No, I have no idea what the title is about...</p>
<p><b>Dec 5</b>:<br />Well, no sketching, but I have done a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>I did some work on my portrait photos and published a few on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/">Flickr acount</a>. (These include some art-nude ones particularly the Katy T ones, so I'm not publishing them here.) And a couple of people who's work I admire on Flickr have actually commented on them.</li>
<li>I've finally met Jeff, who's in charge of the gallery. So it looks like I am getting three pieces of work exhibited.</li>
</ol>
