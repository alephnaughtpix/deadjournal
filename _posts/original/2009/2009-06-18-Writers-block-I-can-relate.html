<div class="question">
	<p class="title">I Can Relate</p>
	<p class="text">What fictional character do you most identify with?</p>
</div>
<p>At the moment, I've been reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down"><strong>Watership Down</strong></a> (After many years of dismissing at as unreadable.), and now I've finally got to the end of it, I'm feeling like Hazel being told:<em> "All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies. And whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first, they must catch you, digger, listener, runner. Prince with a swift warning. Be cunning and your people will never be destroyed."</em></p>
