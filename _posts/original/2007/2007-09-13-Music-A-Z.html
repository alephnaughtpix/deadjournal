<p>Or, "things you make up when you're bored and not wanting to listen to the same old music again in the same order". I decided to make an alphabetical playlist, straight A-Z, with no letters missing, and I was quite surprised to find I could do it with the music on my hard drive. In fact, I could probably do many of them. What I do know is that the difficult letters are D, I, Q X, and Z.
