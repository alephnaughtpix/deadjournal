<p>The problem with writing a blog regularly, at least for me, is the act of actually 
<i>starting</i> more rather than doing it regularly. Once you get me started, there's no 
stopping. I lose all track of time, and can do it on automatic. It's something I do every 
day with my personal "journal". I can generally just start writing and 25 minutes later, 
I've done three pages. So as you can see, I've no problem with regular paper blogging. 
(Or at least, I wouldn't have a problem if my "journal" was a blog, which it isn't.) But 
on the keyboard it's a little different. Why is this?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>One issue is that through keeping the journal, which I've been doing for over a year 
now, i am now faster writing than I am typing, which is a remarkable turnaround, given 
that I'm a programmer by profession. My handwriting my still be crap, but it's now 
<i>less</i> crap, and more importantly, honest and unfiltered, compared to my more 
self-concious computer prose.</p>
<p>The other issue is that it's far easier to delete and censor on a word processor than 
it is on the page. Of course, this might seem a pretty flimsy excuse. After all, you can 
cross out. However, this leaves a mark, even if you're a dab hand with liquid paper. On a 
computer, you can just delete, and it disappears. (Well, it does if you're not using 
versioning software on your word processor.)</p>
<p>The other objection is that when writing, one can censor internally before writing to 
the page. This has much more substance to it. However, one thing is that you can train 
yourself out of that mode. My "journal" is really just what I'm thinking at the time.
Writing it without thinking, no attempt to censor, or make sure anything really makes 
sense. And it doesn't end in disaster, surprisingly enough. Most times I don't know what 
I'm going to write about when I start, and 3 pages later, I find I've been writing 
seriously about something which matters to me deeply without even realising it. Where has 
my mind been during this time. Well, usually in a zone where I just pay attention to the 
mechanics of what I am doing, much like the way I am generally more paying attention to 
the way I am typing at the moment.</p>
<p>I've been reading a book on drawing skills recently called 
"<a href="http://www.drawright.com/">Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</a>", trying 
out the exercises, and I've been trying out the various exercises to get in the 
"right-brain" mode. If you haven't heard of the expression before, then neither had I 
until earlier this year. As the name suggests, it's a term for activities which exercise 
the right hand hemisphere of the brain, where the more creative side of the mind is said 
to reside.</p>
<p>I won't go into it too much here, (Although I might later, as I'm starting to explore 
the subject in more detail now.) but there is a difference in the way one feels when 
getting into an R-brain mode. I started the early exercises in the drawing book, which 
included copying an upside-down drawing. When I finished, I turned my effort the right 
way and and inwardly (and disappointly) joked that at least I can do a Picasso version of
 the face. As it turned out, I had just done a reasonable copy of  
 <a href="http://crocblog.canalblog.com/images/picasso_stravinsky.jpg">Picasso's line 
 drawing of Stravinsky</a>.</p>
 <p>But even more important than that- and the actual point of the exercise- was to 
 notice how one <i>felt</i> during the exercise, and to observe one's actions. During the 
 exercise (Which was designed to put one into R-brain mode by rendering the drawing 
 unrecognisable by making upside down and thus bypass the left brain's tendency to reduce 
 what one sees to symbols.) I noticed that a lot of the times, I was concentrating on 
 just doing the thing rather than thinking about it, and that my concentration sharpened 
 and everything else melted into the background without me noticing. The only important 
 thing was the thing I was doing. I found this revelation quite shocking when I first 
 realised it after the exercise.</p>
<p>Why? Because I had felt that feeling before, when I was doing my journal, and some 
other times. For example, when I was coding to a deadline, and putting together complex 
algorithms on automatic. Other times included the photo shoots I had been doing in 
earnest since February, when I usually only have general ideas for set-ups, and improvise 
around them. Even small things like being in involved conversation without thinking and 
wondering afterwards "How did I come away with saying all <i>that</i>?". Even stranger, 
when I noticed all that, I re-read some books on art and creativity and noticed references 
to "right brain" activity I had never noticed before. Now I noticed, and suddenly it all 
clicked into place, in a manner of speaking.</p>
<p>Call it R-brain, or "in the mode", or whatever you like, there are times when I can do 
lots of things on automatic, generally creative things. And when I' m in the mode for 
blogging, I can write a lot, and generally keep on topic. In fits and starts of course. 
I'm not as good as I am on my journal. But you're not going to see <i>that</i>...</p>
<p>Anyway, what I'm intending to do on my return to blogging is to start getting into the
zone more regularly in the manner than I can get into the zone with my journal. So expect 
a lot more doggerel from me here. And some of it will almost certainly be doggerel. I 
can't exactly pour out my mind onto a page in realtime and not expect to be contradictory, 
haphazard, rambling and obtuse some of the time. But if my journal is anything to go by 
it'll be a lot more organised than one might expect. And as time goes on, it'll probably 
become even more organised as I relax into it. First thing though is that I've got to 
relax into it, and make it a habit. A habit of actually <i>starting</i> it. This is where 
the challenge starts. If some of this sounds like I'm talking to myself, then you're 
probably right. I do often have to spell it out to myself.  </p>
<p>I was reminded of my Livejournal blog via <a href="http://www.blurb.com/">Blurb</a>, 
who have the novel idea of allowing you to turn your blog into a book. Of course, the 
vast majority of blogs, mine included, are not going to be required reading material. 
But it did make me think: what if my blog was to be published, what would it say about 
me? The answer was not exactly positive, but then again, I am no longer really at the 
point where I really give a shit about such things. However, something percolated at the 
back of my mind, and eventually I thought: if a blog can say something about me, why not 
take control of it, and have it actually say what I think? Even if it changes from day to 
day. In fact, the fact that it changes to day are interesting, at least to me. The past 
year has seen major changes in my life. If I change as much in the following 6 months as 
I have in the past 6, it's going to be interesting to read these pages in future...</p>
