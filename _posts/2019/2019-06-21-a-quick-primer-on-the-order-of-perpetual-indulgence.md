**(Again, a reminder that this is my personal blog, so these are my personal views, and I'm not speaking on behalf of the OPI.)**

As I've mentioned on my "[About]({{ "/about/" | relative_url }})" page, I'm active as a member of the [**Order of Perpetual Indulgence**]({{ "/tag/opi.html" | relative_url }}), but who are they, and what are they about?<!--more-->

Well, let's start off this way. Have you ever been to a Pride march, and seen people who look like they're nuns with clown faces and elaborate drag attire: people like this?

If so, you've seen the Order of Perpetual Indulgence (aka The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence)- and they *are* nuns.

The OPI is a group of 21st century secular queer nuns, whose mission is to:
1. **Promulgate Universal Joy**. Promote the (somehow, still radical) idea that it is right to be the beautiful person you are inside.
2. **Expiate Stigmatic Guit**. Removing the unneccessary guilt piled on us by society.
3. **Serve the Community**. This is the LGBT+ community, but we've supported causes in the wider community too. Typical activities including turning up to support events, giving out safer sex packs, (Which contains condoms and lube as well as helpful information) organising coffee mornings etc.

When I say "nuns", I don't mean I just threw on a habit one day and decided to be fabulous. Like nuns, the OPI have a path for anyone wanting to be involved. When I first got involved with them, I was merely their photographer. Then as I got more interested I became an **Aspirant**, someone who wants to join the Sisters on their work. After a few events with the Sisters, and learning their history, I became a **Postulant**, the lowest order for a nun, and wore the clown-face makeup for the first time. (But no lipstick- you're supposed to be listening rather than talking.) 

After that, I learned how to make a formal nun's habit, (All the Sisters have formal habits, with different distinct designs for each group, so you can tell at a glance a member of a particular group, and where they are in their Sister journey.) which meant I could become a **Novice**, the next level up. Now, I could wear lipstick, and I gained the distinctive 'giomp' collar, which gains badges from my various travels.

Next, I'm going to be involved in a project, and hopefully upon completetion of that, and with the agreement of those higher up, I become fully fledged **Sister**. If this sounds quite elaborate, then it's actually *more* elaborate. Going up a level is marked by a ceremony, conducted in public and usually in [Polari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polari), called **Elevation**. There's other things that quite reminiscent of drag culture. For example, you choose a Sister name, which is usually a humourous joke and/or pun. (For example, I'm currently **Novice Wye Dangle of the Shuttering Loins**.) Also, choosing someone as your **Mother** ie mentor. A lot of it is borrowed from relious texts too. A group of the OPI without any fully-fledged Sisters is known as a **Mission**, and one with Sisters is known as a **House**.

When I mentioned history, I wasn't joking, as there is 40 plus years of history of the OPI, which started out as the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in San Fransisco in Easter 1979, and has since spread world wide. The history section in [this handy Wikipedia entry here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Perpetual_Indulgence) will give you an idea, including the roles the Sisters played in the AIDS crisis, including producing the [first ever safer sex guide](https://www.gayinthe80s.com/2013/08/1982-safer-sex-play-fair/) aimed at the LGBT+ community. There is also a great book by Melissa Wilcox called "[Queer Nuns](https://nyupress.org/9781479820368/queer-nuns/)" which contains lots of information about the past and present of the movement.
