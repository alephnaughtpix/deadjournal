I mentioned in [an earlier post]({{"/2019/06/27/its-been-a-long-drag.html"|relative_url}}) about getting ready as [Novice Wye Dangle]({{"/tag/opi.html"|relative_url}}) for Pride Edinburgh. One thing I didn't mention was that I was worried that I wouldn't fit in the  dress I was supposed to be wearing. Normally, I have my Sisters look all sorted, and I know what I'm going to be wearing, and if it fits me. Today, however, I was borrowing someone else's dress, and, rather shamefully, despite being in the Sisters for about 2 years, I didn't know my dress size, but it was kinda important that I did fit in it. Why? Because it was green.

To explain, Sister Liza Viscious of the Edinburgh Sisters had a simple but brilliant idea: to have the Sisters colour coordinate their habits so that each Sister was a different colour- so that individually we'd look striking as always, but together, we'd be a rainbow. It might sound like a small thing, but visually, it stands out enough for people to take notice.

The above photo is by **Andrew Milligan** of **[PA Wire](https://www.paimages.co.uk/)**, and we've counted it pop up in at least 26 publications, frome the Daily Mail's website to the Shropshire Star. It also popped up in print in the Metro Scotland letters page. (The letters were regarding some supposed debate over "Straight Pride", which I've already made [my views clear about]({{"/2019/06/19/Why-we-still-need-Pride.html"|relative_url}})...) This was particularly good, as in this case, someone made the choice to use this image out of all the others.

The act of getting into the mass media is known in the Sisters as *Media Whoring*. In general, this means keeping an eye out for cameras anywhere, especiaally in this age of social media.

I've also found that it's almost impossible to predict which acts will be picked up by the media, (Andrew was one of many professional photographers out at Pride.) or indeed *when* it gets picked up. I've often seen pictures of the Sisters from years ago being as stock go-to images for Pride and LGBT+ stories in the mainstream. One such image of the Glasgow Sisters from Glasgow Pride in 2017 turned up over aa year later in a story about equal marriage in an Italian newspaper.

But, however it happens, when it happens, you have unlocked your Media Whoring acheivement, which is an essential for any aspiring Novice!
