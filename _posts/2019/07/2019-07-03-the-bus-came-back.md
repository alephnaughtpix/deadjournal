Recently, I've been going to **[Category Is Books](https://www.categoryisbooks.com/)**, a fantastic queer bookshop in the Southside of Glasgow. <!--more-->One thing that caught my eye was that in the fanzine section, there were reprints of **Lock Up Your Daughters**, a legendary Glasgow-based queer fanzine from the early 2010s, which had a further life in a spin-off club night, which worked with *[Menergy]({{"/tag/menergy.html" | relative_url }})* in it's early days.

I got this copy because it had a feature on **[Tommy Ga-Ken Wan](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tgkw/)**, a local queer photographer, who was a major influence on my photographic style. I read that with interest, but as I looked through the rest of the zine, I notice this photo of **[Lady Munter]({{"/tag/ladymunter.html" | relative_url }})** in a feature a drag a couple of sections earlier.

*This looks familiar..* I think to myself, and I look at the credits...

This must have been a photo I took of Lady Munter just a few months into the existance of *Menergy*, and I forgot about. I'll need to go back through my archives, and see what else I missed...
