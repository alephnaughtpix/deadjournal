In the US and a lot of other places, June was Pride Month, and I noticed that was used as a sort of shorthand in social media over here for June-ish. Never mind that the UK capital just held it's Pride last Saturday, in July, or that in the British Isles, it's more of a "Pride Season" stretching from late spring to early autumn. A lot of people over here were referrring to Pride Month. The main reason I noticed this was that in the last couple of days, I saw a number of people declaring that were kinda pleased that Pride Month was nearing it's end. Not because they didn't want to celebrate Pride, but because the media coverage of it resulted in increased scrutiny from bigots, and hence increased attacks. Add to that additional bad news, (eg the Scottish Government kicking the can down the road as regards the Gender Recognition Act.) and it seemed to many that extra pressure was been loaded upon us just as we were expected to be all *Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!* in the streets.

Obviously, Prides aren't at fault here, nor the increased visibility which goes hand in hand with it. But at times it can seem like a double-edged sword. It's easier to keep in safe queer spaces. But that's also a double-edged sword too. In an [earlier post]({{"/2019/06/19/Why-we-still-need-Pride.html"|relative_url}}), I was talking about the way society polices my outward behaviour, and I was reminded of it by [Ely Percy's post](https://www.elypercy.com/blog-1/queer-shame) on her blog the other day.

Almost as soon as I read that, I notice Garry Mac had tweeted about an article he had read.

<div class="social-media">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood.&quot;<br><br>This article is a gutpunch. I was just talking the other day about how I was such a femme kid, but that I had to kill that kid to survive into male adulthood. Who would that boy have become? <a href="https://t.co/ENr3ILaebV">https://t.co/ENr3ILaebV</a></p>&mdash; Garry Mac v4.0 has arrived (@GarryMac4) <a href="https://twitter.com/GarryMac4/status/1146365655127613440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

[This is the article](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/) Garry's referring to.  It starts with a lot of stuff that is familar to me.

> The term researchers use to explain this phenomenon is “minority stress.” In its most direct form, it’s pretty simple: Being a member of a marginalized group requires extra effort. When you’re the only woman at a business meeting, or the only black guy in your college dorm, you have to think on a level that members of the majority don’t. If you stand up to your boss, or fail to, are you playing into stereotypes of women in the workplace? If you don’t ace a test, will people think it’s because of your race? Even if you don’t experience overt stigma, considering these possibilities takes its toll over time.

> For gay people, the effect is magnified by the fact that our minority status is hidden. Not only do we have to do all this extra work and answer all these internal questions when we’re 12, but we also have to do it without being able to talk to our friends or parents about it.
