title: About deadjournal, and why it's not on Livejournal

Once I ran a blog on Livejournal, almost a decade ago. Then I forgot about it. Then Livejournal got bought by a Russian company, but the servers stayed in the West. Then, at some unspecified point in 2016, [the servers moved to Russia](https://puzzling.org/politics-and-society/2017/01/if-youre-still-maintaining-a-livejournal-your-journals-now-in-russia/) before anyone noticed.

Why is this important? Well, there's obviously a bit of a problem having your data on servers in a country known to have a record of cyber warfare. There is also a more personal reason. 
In 2014, Russia passed a law requiring bloggers with an audience of over 3000 to [register with a government media regulator](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28583669). This applies to Livejournal
now that it is hosted on Russian servers. So it also applied to my blog.

Furthermore, and even more personally, in 2013, Russia [passed a law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_gay_propaganda_law) against what it called the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" and "distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships.". This also applies to my blog, as some of the content is unashamedly queer.

This blog is being hosted on GitHub Pages, using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll). My
old Livejournal posts (2006-2011) were extracted from my LJ account using [LJDump](https://hewgill.com/ljdump/).
