Once I ran a blog on Livejournal, almost a decade ago. Then I forgot about it. Then Livejournal got bought by a Russian company, but the servers stayed in the West. Then, at some unspecified point in 2016, [the servers moved to Russia](https://puzzling.org/politics-and-society/2017/01/if-youre-still-maintaining-a-livejournal-your-journals-now-in-russia/) before anyone noticed.
Why this is a problem, why it prompted me to move my LiveJournal blog to this site [is explained in this post](/2019/05/22/About-Deadjournal.html).

This blog is being hosted on GitHub Pages, using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll). My
old Livejournal posts (2006-2011) were extracted from my LJ account using 
[LJDump](https://hewgill.com/ljdump/).
