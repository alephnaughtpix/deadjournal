<event>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title="Orderly Disorder March 2010 by alephnaught, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/4419920103/"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="369" alt="Orderly Disorder March 2010" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4419920103_166be70910.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above picture is from my regular club photography gig at Orderly Disorder in The Flying Duck in Glasgow. Over the past two years I've been sliding into &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/collections/72157612721067698/"&gt;club photography&lt;/a&gt;, starting with a few innocent snaps with a little compact in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/sets/72157594569180519/"&gt;The  Riverside club during Utter Gutter&lt;/a&gt;. I think that the thing that connects my work, from those days to now, is the attempt to capture a slice of time that captures the essence of what I consider to be the original USP of the rave sensibility that begat modern clubbing: the spontaneity of adults in play, not giving a monkeys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many times in the old pre-rave days, as now, dancing was regarded as a courtship ritual, and it was judged: do you dance like Travolta, or someone's dad? The great thing about rave, which flowered as I hit university, was that you danced because you &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; to dance- usually prompted by some incredible tune, pumping from the speakers straight into your brain- and so did the entire universe around you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't then aware of the &lt;a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/35453.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Japanese proverb&lt;/a&gt; quoted in the title, but it makes perfect sense. Let people dance like their dads, or even their dad's dads: as long as they are dancing like &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt;, comfortable in their movement, movement that they fully own. Their movement and nobody else's. Better to dance and be thought a fool. After all, we are fools, whether we dance or not.</event>
