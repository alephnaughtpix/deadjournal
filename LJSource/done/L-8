<event>Have you ever experienced a time of limbo whenever you were waiting to find out if someone you knew was alive or dead? When you’re fresh with the memories of them as a vital living person, and not too sure if that’s all you’re going to have by the end of the same day. Wondering on earth to do if the worst happens, whilst still ready welcome them with open arms when they appear next again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been recently acquainted with such a feeling. One of my close friends went overseas (By overseas, I mean &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; overseas, outside the Eurozone) to meet the love of his life. They had met when she was over here for a year of her university course. Now she’s back in her own country, and Friend A goes over for a week. About 4 days into the week, two unknown men threaten in him, and tell him in no uncertain terms to back off his girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time he’s ever been overseas, and he’s travelling alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So he calls one of my other friends back home, and is right pissed off. He’s off to the pub, he tells her. I meet Friend B later for dinner at &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;hs=BSq&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;q=ichiban&amp;amp;near=Glasgow&amp;amp;radius=0.0&amp;amp;latlng=55865627,-4257224,10567381533569310274&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ichiban&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and almost as soon as she’s told me the latest, friend A phones from his hotel room overseas. He’s clearly drunk a lot. “I’m in Hell,” he croaks. And then he says he has written “a note”. I say what kind of note, and he hangs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit spooked, I try phoning again- no reply. I go back to my noodles, whilst friend B phones him up, but my appetite is a little subdued: a &lt;i&gt;note&lt;/i&gt;? Surely he’s aware of the possible implication of saying something like that. Friend B comes back. The conversation with A was a bit surreal. He couldn’t get through to the girlfriend on the phone, but apparently he will be sober in the morning, whether or not the note applies. Er, excuse me? Whether or not the note &lt;i&gt;applies&lt;/i&gt;? Oh yes, and he also had a message to pass onto his girlfriend. This is sounding more and more ominous by the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B phones up the girlfriend and apparently A was threatening suicide, which was why she was not answering his calls. Oh and can you pass this message onto A? B, feeling a little like one of those children passing on messages between estranged parents, diplomatically suggested suggested it would probably be better if Girlfriend of A passes on the message to him herself. “This is not good at all” B comments later. When B says something is not good she means it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We retire to the pub for a drink and watch the football. We’re saying things like “Oh, he’ll probably be OK” and basically putting a brave face on things, but we’re doing it under a massive cloud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I phone his hotel phone number, not knowing what to expect. For the past 12 hours, A’s been in a limbo state; both dead and alive- like &lt;a href="http://www.galactic-guide.com/articles/8R56.html"&gt;Schrödinger’s Cat&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for the box to be opened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phone is answered almost immediately. As soon as I say hello, a familiar voice, sounding very hangover goes: &lt;i&gt;“Oh hi man, how you doing?”&lt;/i&gt;</event>
