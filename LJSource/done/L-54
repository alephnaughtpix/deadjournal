<event>&lt;lj-template id="1403" name="qotd" lang="en_LJ" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got two cats, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/4310207300/"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alephnaught/4263085474/"&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt;. Ellie's the boss, and Oscar's the &amp;quot;shy&amp;quot; one. I put &amp;quot;shy&amp;quot; in quotes because he's not too shy around me. As soon as I'm any where near a chair, up he pops, tail in the air, meowing in a low dry growl, like a cross between &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGbZm-h1zac"&gt;Henry's Cat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VOYcRXzs1Y"&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;. Ellie, despite being the boss cat, has what one of my friends would describe as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my gosh, that's like the daintiest cat meow like &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. &lt;/em&gt;But she's always meowing at me, especially when I'm in bed. I'll be reading something, and I hear a little dainty noise behind the book, usually as a prelude to Ellie's head popping up above the pages, and attempting to head-butt the book down. Something tells me she's looking for attention. Maybe she's jealous of the attention that Oscar's getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as far as I'm concerned, the cats are already talking to me, and have been for&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;time. However, if they were to talk in &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt;, I suspect it would be something a bit like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EastEnders"&gt;EastEnders&lt;/a&gt;, with Oscar as Frank Butcher&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;quot;Awright, ma saaaaahhhn?&amp;quot;) &lt;/em&gt;and Ellie as Dot Cotton. Actually, thinking on that, it's perhaps just as well they don't speak English, as I flippin hate EastEnders, and it would do my head in.</event>
